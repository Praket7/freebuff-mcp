# Changelog

## 0.1.5

- Add normalized, redacted, bounded live Desktop progress via `/api/events`.
- Add `get_thread_progress` polling and bounded `watch_thread` long-polling.
- Add phase labels, progress summaries, active-thread watching, fresh readiness metadata discovery, and a safe Codex install helper.
- Omit detailed reasoning deltas from normalized live progress by default.
- Keep live event history in memory and stop the event client on runtime disposal.

## 0.1.4

- Document cross-platform Codex, CLI, and HTTP setup.
- Correct the HTTP security policy and explain optional Cloudflare use.

## 0.1.3
